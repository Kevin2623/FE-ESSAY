1.  Differentiate between SIMD and MIMD? Explain
The difference between SIMD and MIMD is SIMD requires small or less memory than MIMD. 
Because MIMD requires more or large memory. And another difference is the cost of SIMD is less than MIMD 

4. Explain what pipelining is
A pipeline is the continuous and somewhat overlapped movement of instruction to the processor or in the arithmetic steps taken by the processor to perform an instruction. 
And the purpose of pipelining is Pipelining keeps all portions of the processor occupied and increases the amount of useful work the processor can do in a given time. 
Pipelining typically reduces the processor's cycle time and increases the throughput of instructions.
